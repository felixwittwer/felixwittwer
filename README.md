Hi,<br>
I'm Felix, a German grammar school student.<br>
<br>
Iâ€™m currently working on a conways game of life simulation for the CASIO fx-9860 GII and GIII Series.<br>
In addition, I'm looking forward to collaborate with others on future projects.<br>
I'm publishing my projects so that everybody can use them and maybe learn from them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Development is key.
