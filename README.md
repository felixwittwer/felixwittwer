Hi,<br>
I'm Felix, a German grammar school student.<br>
<br>
Iâ€™m currently working on a oscillation and wave calculator for the CASIO fx-9860 GII and GIII Series.<br>
In addition, I'm looking forward to collaborate with others on further CASIO projects.<br>
I'm publishing my projects so that others can use them and maybe learn from it.<br>
<br>
Development is key.
