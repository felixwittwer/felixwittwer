Hi,<br>
I'm Felix, a German grammar school student.<br>
<br>
Iâ€™m currently working on a CAS for the CASIO fx-9860 GII and GIII Series.<br>
In addition, I'm looking to collaborate with @PilotHaribo on further CASIO projects.<br>
Furthermore, I'm publishing my projects so that others can use them and maybe learn from it.<br>
<br>
Development is key.
